                            Beth was instrumental in guiding, and leading, the planning and
                            execution of our franchise's first-ever Deaf Awareness Night. Her
                            attention to detail, and incredible knowledge of ASL and the Deaf
                            Community, resulted in a successful event that we are excited to
                            continue as an annual highlight of our team's season.

                            Due to this connection [with the City of Boynton, facilitated by
                            Beth], I have been able to secure an On The Job Training for a
                            very deserving woman. She has begun this OJT with great success
                            and support by the City and this would not have been possible
                            without the connection that I made with Beth. Beth went out of her
                            way to assist me and she saw it through to make sure we had
                            everything we needed to make this employment match for her a

                            success.

                            of passionately advocating for inclusivity for all people, not just
                            for d/Deaf or hard of hearing community. She understands the challenges
                            of both the business owner and the community and she always presents
                            creative solutions that are able to meet the needs of both parties.
